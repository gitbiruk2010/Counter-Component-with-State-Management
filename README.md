This React Counter App is a simple application designed to demonstrate state management in React, including asynchronous state updates and batching behavior. It features a counter with various controls to increment, decrement, and reset the count in different ways.

## Features

- **Increment**: Increases the count by 1.
- **Increment After Delay**: Increases the count by 1 after a 2-second delay, showcasing asynchronous state updates.
- **Increment Twice**: Attempts to increment the count by 2 immediately, demonstrating React's batching of state updates.
- **Correct Increment Twice**: Correctly increments the count by 2, using a state updater function to accurately manage state based on the most recent state.
- **Reset**: Resets the count to 0. This button is styled distinctly in red to highlight its functionality.
